### Team Biographies

#### Ayanna St. Rose
In spring of 2019, I began my PhD with Dr. Kusum Naithani, while pursuing a Masters of Science in Biological Statistical Analysis. I am interested in investigating climate-carbon feedback at ground, leaf and landscape scale. I am currently working on an NSF funded project to explore natural genetic variation of photosynthetic machinery in crops to tolerate drought and elevated nighttime temperature. I plan to investigate climate-carbon feedback at landscape scale using landscape and regional models. I intend to utilize data from the National Ecological Observatory Network data, an open access data portal with sites all over the US, and other similar open-data products (e.g., Ameriflux) to study how canopy structure affects biodiversity.

#### Sebastian Calleja
I am a first year plant science PhD student at the University of Arizona. My current research for the Pauli Lab involves understanding a plant's dynamic response to abiotic stress throughout a growing season. My research is conducted at the Maricopa Agricultural Center, home of the world's largest land phenotyping robot. This robot is equipped with multiple sesnsors which we can leverage to better understand plant physiological traits. I am currently working on extracting information from the robot's FLIR thermal sensor, so we can gain more knowledge about the crop's water dynamics in periods of drought stress.
