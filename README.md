### Team Biographies

#### Ayanna St. Rose
In spring of 2019, I began my PhD with Dr. Kusum Naithani, while pursuing a Masters of Science in Biological Statistical Analysis. I am interested in investigating climate-carbon feedback at ground, leaf and landscape scale. I am currently working on an NSF funded project to explore natural genetic variation of photosynthetic machinery in crops to tolerate drought and elevated nighttime temperature. I plan to investigate climate-carbon feedback at landscape scale using landscape and regional models. I intend to utilize data from the National Ecological Observatory Network data, an open access data portal with sites all over the US, and other similar open-data products (e.g., Ameriflux) to study how canopy structure affects biodiversity.
